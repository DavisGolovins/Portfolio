    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>Here are some things I like to do in my spare time.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="hobby-col">
            <h3>Gaming</h3>
            <p> One of my main passions is gaming. Having played since I was younger, I still remember my first console and from then on. I was hooked.<br>
                 I compete in E-Sports with my college club, give tutorials to new players and use gaming as an effective way to unwind after working on college projects.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="hobby-col">
            <h3>Drawing</h3>
            <p>I love to draw in my spare time, and it was this love that ultimately made me pursue my course in Interactive Digital Art and Design.<br>
                 I love the attention to detail, and the the creativity that comes from this work.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="hobby-col">
            <h3>Learning</h3>
            <p>I love to learn new skills and this is where my love for programming and web development stems from.<br>
             I love to learn new ways of solving issues with websites, using out of the box ideas to design, and complete projects.
